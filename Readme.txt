The company wanted a landing webpage with 3 main sections Home, About Us(Team and Contact Us. And they also want to have a domain with the name of motive-industry and a full email server which they add more than 10 employees with different storage each (the storage of each email account can be manipulated at any time with any value) and also connect these emails with outlook on the company computers so that they can have a backup of these emails, email account should work on any email application (Gmail, outlook, windows mail, etc.) and they also wanted to add the location of the company.

I Have bought he domain, and subscribed to hosting service that will meet their demands and got them 5$ discount and free SSL/TLS certificates for the first year and made the landing page then connecting it with the domain name to be published world widely.

I have added the location with a new method to make it easier for the user to access the location by only clicking on the map it will direct the user to google maps mobile application if browsing from mobile phone.
the photos added for "Team" are just a demo until they photoshoot the real team

you can still see the landing page webpage by clicking on the this github pages link->  

And currently i am upgrading the website using woo-commerce to be an online store.
